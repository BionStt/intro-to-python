## Beginner Workshop
Python is a popular programming language and one that we use at Made.com for our back-office computer software. In this 
workshop we will be looking at the basics of Python and programming including; variables, functions and loops. 

As an example of what you could achieve with Python after some study and understanding, see the example programs in 
[/intermediate/lesson_1](/intermediate/lesson_1). These include the program [lucky.py](/intermediate/lesson_1/lucky.py) 
which given a search term, will open the first 5 results in Google for you, 
[weather.py](/intermediate/lesson_1/weather.py) which will print today's temperature from BBC Weather and
[social.py](/intermediate/lesson_1/social.py) which login to your Facebook account and submit a post on your profile. 
And at the end of this workshop I can show you a Python program [lottery.py](/intermediate/lesson_1/lottery.py) that 
will enter the lottery for a theatre show Harry Potter and the Cursed Child!

### Task 1 - Compare values
Hopefully you have Python installed on your computer. 

```
>>> print("Hello, World!")
>>> 1 == 1
True
>>> 1 == 0
False
>>> 
```

integers, strings and variables)

### Lesson 1 - Controlling Code
Knowing how to read the flow of code, and control it yourself, is vital in programming. Some computer programs can be 
read top to bottom, others are distributed between multiple files and groups of code lines. This lesson should help you
in starting to understand these concepts and techniques.

Again, read through the 2 chapters below and try out the examples. If you come across errors, double check the code you
have written, as someone else to check it looks correct or break the problem down line by line, to ensure everything you
think is working, is.

operators, conditions, if statements, while loops, for loops, importing modules)

handling 

### Lesson 2 - Data Structures
Lesson #2! You're half way through the Beginner level lessons for this course, well done!! Today we will be looking at
what programmers call "data structures" which is a posh way of saying "data grouped together in a particular way". 

This will include `lists` which are values that contains other values in a particular order, such as a list of integers 
i.e. `[1, 3, 5, 7]`. We also have `tuples` which are similar to lists, but their subtle differences will be explained.
Last but not least, dictionaries, again a collection of values but with more useful ways of identifying data within them
using "keys". Read on dear colleague, and all will be revealed...

[Chapter 4](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter4/) - The list and tuple data types and methods

[Chapter 5](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter5/) - The dictionary data type and structuring data with them

### Lesson 3 - Strings
In programming we refer to text values as "strings", this is because in dawn of programming, this term was used to
describe a series of numbers or words, a "string of 1s". Moving on, text is extremely useful as input and output in
computer programs, so let's see how Python can let us play with strings.
