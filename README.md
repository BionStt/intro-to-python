# Intro to Python
A series of workshops for MADE employees to automate everyday computer tasks using the online, free course Automate The 
Boring Stuff (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

To get the most out of our time in the workshops, chapters and lessons from the course will be assigned _before_ every 
workshop as homework, and the time in the workshop will be used to cover questions and provide 1-to-1 support.

The course includes a series of YouTube videos that contain the same content as the text, so feel free to use whichever 
works best for you.

## Lesson 0 - Warm Up
The first 6 chapters of Automate The Boring Stuff cover all the basics of Python that you need for this course, so
please read chapters 0-5 and we will cover any questions that you have in Workshop 0. Work along with the examples and 
test your learning with the questions in each chapter. If you have any questions that you'd like to ask before our 
workshop, post them on the Made Slack channel `#python-workshops` and someone will get back to you in a jiff.

Chapter 0 - An introduction to setting up your computer with Python and the software required

Chapter 1 - The basics of the Python programming language (expressions, integers, strings and variables)

Chapter 2 - Controlling the flow of programs (booleans, comparison operators, conditions, if statements, while loops, 
for loops, importing modules)

Chapter 3 - What are functions, global and local scope and exception handling 

Chapter 4 - The list and tuple data types and methods

Chapter 5 - The dictionary data type and structuring data with them

Chapter 6 - Working with strings and useful string methods

The next 4 chapters are extremely useful to get the most out of these workshops, but that's a lot of reading, so they're
not mandatory.

Chapter 7 - Searching strings for patterns using regular expressions

Chapter 8 - Reading and writing files

Chapter 9 - Copying, moving, renaming and compressing files

Chapter 10 - Debugging your code and fixing issues üêõ

## Lesson 1 - Web Scraping
What the bloody hell is web scraping??? Do we take a shovel and start running it across our computer screens? Well 
obviously not, but it actually isn't that far from the analogy of shovelling data from a website into your own program.
Web scraping is the term used to describe a program that downloads data from a website, processes it and produces an 
output. Maybe a report of all the products that a competitor is selling for cheaper, or any updates to a website since 
the program last ran.

Have a read up of Chapter 11 from Automate The Boring Stuff, and Al will explain the `webbrowser` builtin module, 
opening web pages and downloading them, formatting web pages with `Beautiful Soup` and clicking around websites using 
the `Selenium` Python module.

## Lesson 2 - Spreadsheet Manipulation
