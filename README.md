# Intro to Python
Workshops for MADE employees to automate everyday computer tasks using the online, free course 'Automate The Boring
Stuff' (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

The workshops are split into Beginner and Intermediate. The first set of lessons are for colleagues with no or minimal 
previous Python or programming experience, who would like to get their head around the foundation of programming with 
Python. Then there are lessons for Intermediate level programmers - colleagues who have worked with Python or other 
programming languages before and would like to learn about web scraping and spreadsheet manipulation with Python.

You'll find that all of the 'Automate The Boring Stuff' chapters referred to in this course include a corresponding
YouTube video that contain the same content as the text, so feel free to use whichever works best for you.
